## Chores
- [x] Chr1 - Replace div-content-editables for inputs in prompts where it makes sense
- [x] Chr2 - Rename terminal-history (print-history) and transient-output (display)
- [x] Chr3 - Deal with enter when select is not multiselect (should select and submit)


## Spikes


## Bugs & Fixes
- [ ] Bug1 - Terminal create, delete and select is inconsistent.
    - [x] Bug1.1 - There shouldn't be less than 1 terminal
    - [x] Bug1.2 - Terminal select should use indexes, not ids
    - [x] Bug1.3 - Terminal create should get the biggest id and create id+1, on last index of array
    - [x] Bug1.4 - Terminal delete shouldn't happen when only one terminal (see Bug1.1)
    - [ ] Bug1.5 - When terminal delete, active or selected index should remain the same because the next terminal will take the deleted one's place

## To Be Defined (TBD)
- [ ] Tbd1 - Single base prompt component, with input types as children components
- [ ] Tbd2 - Scroll bottom when prompt is too long
- [ ] Tbd3 - Handle persistence with PipelineContext (sessionStorage, localStorage and cookies)
