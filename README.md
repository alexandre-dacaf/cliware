# Introduction

Cliware is a modern framework that brings the retro charm of a command-line interface (CLI) to the web. Built with React, it provides a powerful yet simple way to design front-end applications optimized for keyboard navigation, catering to power users who value speed and efficiency. While Cliware resembles a terminal, it is not a terminal emulatorâ€”it is a highly customizable framework designed to create intuitive workflows through commands and pipelines.

The heart of Cliware lies in its declarative blueprint configuration file, where you can define command flows with ease. Each command is composed of a **task pipeline**, and the tasks within these pipelines can be of two types: 

- **PROMPT** tasks: Pre-built prompts for inputs such as text, numbers, dates, selectors, and more.  
- **ACTION** tasks: Custom TypeScript functions capable of executing advanced logic, interacting with APIs, displaying data, and much more.  

This framework is perfect for crafting sleek, functional front-ends with a retro CLI aesthetic, allowing developers to quickly assemble applications with minimal effort. Whether you're building tools for internal systems, showcasing data interactively, or enabling task automation, Cliware combines beauty and functionality in a streamlined package designed for speed, flexibility, and elegance.
